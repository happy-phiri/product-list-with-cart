## What I Learned

Building this project deepened my understanding of managing state in React, particularly in handling product quantities dynamically within a cart. Working with TailwindCSS allowed me to rapidly style the UI and ensure a responsive design. The project also reinforced my knowledge of JavaScript array methods to manage adding, updating, and removing items in the cart.
